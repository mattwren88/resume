Matthew,Wren,,,,Web Development Support and Services Specialist,"As a seasoned web designer and developer with over 10 years of experience, I have a proven track record of designing and developing high-performance, accessible websites that meet the needs of both users and businesses. My current role as a Web Designer/Developer at The University of Scranton has given me ample opportunities to hone my skills and contribute to various projects.  One of my major achievements has been designing and developing The Scranton Journal website from scratch, with a focus on performance and accessibility. I also created extensive documentation with step-by-step instructions for creating a new issue of the publication, making it easy for a small team to manage the site. In addition, I integrated various feeds into the site and updated the Header/Footer sitewide to a mega-menu, which streamlined the site's navigation and made updates easy to implement.  In my role, I also developed and integrated the University News Website, which involved integrating a Beacon-designed news website into Cascade using various Velocity techniques and Cascade's API. I recently updated the site to provide more useful information to users, enhanced performance, and improved accessibility.  My expertise in web design and development has earned me recognition in the industry. I was invited to present at the Cascade User Conference 2016, where I shared my experience of converting a non-responsive Scranton Journal publication website into a responsive site using Bootstrap. This involved integrating Bootstrap's grid into our current CSS and using SCSS for the integration, which I then applied to the updated class names within the XSLT and template files.  Overall, I'm passionate about designing and developing websites that are not only visually appealing but also functionally efficient, user-friendly, and accessible to all. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in my field and collaborate with other like-minded professionals.",Higher Education,18505,"Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States",[MattGerardWren],[PERSONAL:http://www.matthew-wren.com/],
